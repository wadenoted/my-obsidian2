Read Chapters 1 - 3 in the textbook and answer the following questions:

# Problem 1 - 10 points
In this problem we will analyze a stirred tank chemical reactor with three reagents: $A$, $B$, and $C$. The reactions for this system are given below, with all reactions first order with the rate constants shown: the rate of the second reaction is $k_BC_B$ in the forward direction and $k_CC_C$ in the reverse direction.
$$A \stackrel{k_A}{\longrightarrow} B \xLeftrightarrow[\text k_C]{\; \text k_B \;} C$$
Only component $A$ enters in the feed, and $B$ and $C$ are produced in the reactor. The reactor was initially at steady-state operation before a step change in the inlet concentration of $A$ occurs.

Formulate a model of the process. You should end up with a set of 3 differential equations.
Solve the appropriate differential equation for the concentration of $A$ in the reactor $(C_A)$ after a step in the inlet concentration of size $\Delta C_{A0}$. You can solve for the deviation variable $C_A^\prime = C_A - C_{AS}$ You ONLY need to solve for $C_A$ not $C_B$ or $C_C$

# Problem 2 - 10 points
