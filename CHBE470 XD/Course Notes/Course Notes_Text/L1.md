# Introduction to Process Control

most chemical engineering coursework assumes the processes are at steady state
however, most processes are NOT at steady state in the real world
we need tools and an approach for dealing with dynamic processes

examples of dynamic processes:
    - reactor with variable feed
    - temperature in a building
    - steam power plant where temperature of condenser changers
    - our bodies - metabolic regulation, heart rate, etc. 

this course is about methods for automated, feedback control
we will study:
    - process dynamics
    - process control
    - stability: most of the process we will look at are stable, but they can easily be made unstable using an improperly designed feedback control system

## general process schematic
L1.1
![[imgL1_1.PNG]]
reactor, liquid mixing tank, building, cell, chemical plant, city, or the entire planet

feedback control systems use an output to change or influence an input
L1.2![[imgL1_2.png]]
sensor: provides a real-time measurement
final elements: equipment that influence the input
controller: uses the measurement to adjust the final element

## criteria for feedback control
1. measured controlled variable
2. adjustable manipulated variable
3. causal effect from manipulated to controlled variable

Example:

reasons for feedback control
1. disturbances
2. changes to desired output
3. model mismatch

1. control $T_1$ by adjusting $V_2$
2. control $T_1$ by adjusting $V_1$
3. control $T_1$ by measuring $T_2$ and adjusting $V_2$ to compensate
4. someone manually changing $V_1$ to control $T_1$

See Fig 1.8 in book for more typical layout
In Fig 1.8, can the following be controlled by feedback control?
- $L_{2}$ Flash Drum Level
- $T_{5}$ Reactor Temperature
- $P_{1}$ Flash Drum Pressure

## Chapter 2: Major Control Objectives
1. Safety

3. Equipment Protection
4. Smooth Operation Production
5. Product Quality
6. Profit
7. Monitoring & Diagnosis
